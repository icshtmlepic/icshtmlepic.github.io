	<p> The Chicago Bears has the most faithful fans in the NFL. Now you can ask about every fan and say there team has the most faithful fans, but the Chicago 	Bears, by far, has the most faithful fans. Bears fans have not had a Super Bowl apperance since 2006, last win, 1985. So, the Bears have not made a Super Bowl 	apperance in 19 years and haven't won a Super Bowl in 40 YEARS! If you think thats not faithful, than I don't know what is.
