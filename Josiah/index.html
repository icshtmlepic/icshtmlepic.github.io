<h3 style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 50px; text-align: center;"> The Vikings have been getting worse and worse, and heres why; </h3>


<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> The first bad thing that happened to the Vikings was when they lost their quarterback, Kirk Cousins. He was mediocre, but he was a decent part of their franchise. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> They drafted a rookie quarterback, J.J. Mcarthy, and he was expected to be good, but then he got hurt. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> They got a better quarterback, Sam Darnold, and were one of the best teams in the NFL, but then there was an upset and they lost in the first round of the playoffs. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> The Minnesota Vikings ended up losing Sam Darnold too, and the downfall started. The next year, J.J. Mcarthy was expected to start. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> But he wasn't as talented as the older quarterbacks, and now the Vikings aren't as good. But the team Sam Darnold plays for leads their division, so the Vikings clearly should've signed him back. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> Their receivers haven't gotten better either. Justin Jefferson used to be the best WR in the league, but he's gotten worse since then. </p>
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"> Most of their good receivers have either gotten worse, or they've left. </p>
