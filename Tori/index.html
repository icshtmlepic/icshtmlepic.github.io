	<p>I think that the best breed for barrel racing would be a paint horse in first, unlike this website:</a>

	 A barrel racing horse needs to be free from injury and conformational flaws,  menaing that they must have good bone structures, and  which is critical to withstand the high-impact demands of barrel racing turns and explosion can be hard on an average horse's fetlock which can easily be damaged. A successful barrel racing horse combines speed, agility, sound conformation, intelligence, and a willingness to work with its rider, making the horse able to navigate tight turns and maintain consistent, fast performance in the arena. Now, even though the horse must be smart and broken to round the barrels, the rider also must match the horse, knowing thier strengths and weaknesses so they know when to turn take off from the final turns, and most of all, when to turn in general! Compact muscling and strong bone structure: Supports stamina, agility, and repeated high-intensity performance. Exercise and conditioning that target core muscles, hindquarters, and joints help a horse maintain speed, balance, and endurance for a barrel horse. Horses that are experienced with different barrel patterns learn how to approach each barrel efficiently, minimizing wipe-through penalties. Though still waiting the rider to give zconformation of their timing. Quick reflexes and trust in the rider allow the horse to adjust stride and direction instantly during tight turns, which i think is the most important thing of a barrel racing horse.</a>
